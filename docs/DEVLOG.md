# Development Log

This log tracks significant development milestones, architectural decisions, and implementation notes for Gemma Code.

## [2026-04-05] Project Kickoff

### Summary

Initialized the Gemma Code repository and established the project foundation.

### Vision

Gemma Code aims to replicate the agentic, codebase-aware workflow of tools like Claude Code, but running entirely offline via Ollama and Google's Gemma 4. The core design principle is privacy-first: no code, prompt, or context ever leaves the developer's machine.

The initial feature target includes:
- Multi-file codebase reading and reasoning
- Autonomous file editing with user confirmation
- Terminal command execution and output interpretation
- Multi-step task planning and execution

### Tech Stack Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Extension language | TypeScript | VS Code extensions are natively TypeScript; best tooling and API support |
| Inference layer | Python + Ollama REST API | Ollama provides a well-maintained local model server with a simple HTTP interface; Python is the natural fit for LLM tooling |
| Performance components | Rust | For any hot-path work (file indexing, tokenization helpers) where TypeScript or Python would be too slow |
| CLI/tooling | Go | Lightweight, fast-starting binaries for any standalone tooling or daemon components |
| Local model | Google Gemma 4 | Strong reasoning capability, runs well on consumer hardware via Ollama, and is fully open-weight |

### Initial Scaffold

Created the following structure:

```
CLAUDE.md       Project configuration for Claude Code assistant
README.md       Project overview and setup instructions
CHANGELOG.md    Version history (Keep a Changelog format)
.gitignore      Covers TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, and VS Code extension artifacts
src/            Extension source (TypeScript)
lib/            Shared libraries
tests/          Test suites
docs/           Documentation (this file lives here)
configs/        Configuration files
scripts/        Build and utility scripts
assets/         Icons and static assets
examples/       Demo workflows
```

### Next Steps

- Define the VS Code extension manifest (`package.json`) and activation events
- Set up the TypeScript project with `tsconfig.json`, ESLint, and Prettier
- Scaffold the Ollama HTTP client in Python
- Design the agent loop architecture (tool use, planning, confirmation flow)
- Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for linting and testing across all four language stacks
